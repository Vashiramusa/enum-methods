# Enumerables Project
This is my version of implementing some of [Ruby's Enumerable Module](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html) traversal and searching methods.
I specifically implemented #each, #each_with_index, #select, #all?, #any?, #none?, #count, #map, and #inject.
This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks).
## Installation
Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:
```
$ git clonehttps://github.com/Vashiramusa/enum-methods
$ cd enumerable_methods
$ load "enumerable_methods.rb"
```
## Pre-Project Thoughts
One thing I want to get out of this specifically is a better understanding of blocks and yielding.
## Post-Project Thoughts

I developed a stronger understanding of yielding and blocks. I believe the only fundamental concept in Ruby that I need to practice/comprehend more is lambdas,proc and Methods.
